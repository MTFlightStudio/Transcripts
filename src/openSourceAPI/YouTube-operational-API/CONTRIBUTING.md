## Contributing as a user

### Empower the no-key service

- [If you don't have a YouTube Data API v3 key](#if-you-dont-have-a-youtube-data-api-v3-key)
- [If you already have a YouTube Data API v3 key](#if-you-already-have-an-youtube-data-api-v3-key)

#### If you don't have a YouTube Data API v3 key

The following procedure requires you to have a Google account, don't hesitate to create an ad hoc account.

Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate

Click on the `CREATE` button.

Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/youtube.googleapis.com

Click on the `ENABLE` button.

Click on the `CREATE CREDENTIALS` button.

Choose the `Public data` option.

Click on the `NEXT` button.

Copy the displayed `API Key`.

#### If you already have an YouTube Data API v3 key

Note that sharing your YouTube Data API v3 key means that you can't rely on its quota for your personal usage of it.

Go to: https://yt.lemnoslife.com

Paste your API key to the field next to `Share your YouTube Data API v3 key to power the no-key service:` and click on the `share` button.

If the message `YouTube Data API v3 key added.` is displayed, it means that your contribution got confirmed, thank you!

Don't hesitate to repeat this procedure with as many Google accounts as you can (don't hesitate to create ad hoc accounts).
